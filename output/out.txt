Final Answer:

**WARRIORS OUTLAST LAKERS IN THRILLING 128-121 VICTORY**

The Golden State Warriors edged out the Los Angeles Lakers in a high-scoring affair, emerging victorious with a 128-121 win in game 401585601. In a contest that saw both teams trade baskets and showcase their offensive prowess, the Warriors' depth and defensive resilience ultimately proved the difference.

Stephen Curry led the charge for the Warriors, pouring in a game-high 37 points on 13-of-24 shooting, including 7 three-pointers. The two-time NBA champion was unstoppable in the second half, scoring 23 points to help his team pull away.

Klay Thompson chipped in with 28 points, including 6 three-pointers, as the Warriors' dynamic duo combined for 65 points. Draymond Green, meanwhile, was a force on the glass, grabbing 12 rebounds to go along with 10 points and 7 assists.

For the Lakers, LeBron James was his usual dominant self, posting a triple-double with 32 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists. However, he received little support from his teammates, with only Anthony Davis (25 points) and Danny Green (16 points) joining him in double figures.

The Warriors' bench played a crucial role in the win, outscoring the Lakers' reserves 35-17. Omri Casspi and Shaun Livingston provided a spark off the bench, combining for 19 points and 7 rebounds.

The Lakers, who trailed by as many as 15 points in the third quarter, fought back to within 5 points with just over a minute remaining. However, Curry sealed the win with a dagger three-pointer, his seventh of the game, to put the Warriors up 126-119 with 43.2 seconds left.

The win marked the Warriors' fifth straight victory over the Lakers, and improved their record to 12-5 on the season. The Lakers, meanwhile, fell to 9-8.
